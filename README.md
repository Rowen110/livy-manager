## Issues Livy Manager Tackles with
* It is difficult for non-developer Livy users to monitor or kill their Livy sessions and Spark applications.
    * They have to use an HTTP client tool like `curl` to call the Livy REST APIs.
    * Additionally, they have to manipulate machines on which a Kerberos client is installed if the Livy service is Kerberized.
    * In some services which use Livy, there's no way to kill a Livy sessions while a Spark application is running, so users cannot stop their Spark applications when they submitted a heavy and long running application accidentally.

## Solutions Livy Manager provides
* Non-developer Livy users can see and kill their Livy sessions.
* Optional LDAP authentication and authorization feature is included.
    * Admin users can see and kill all of the Livy sessions.
    * Non-admin users can see and kill only their Livy sessions.
    * This feature works well with Zeppelin with LDAP authentication and the Livy interpreter.
